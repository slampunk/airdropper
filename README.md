# Airdropper

Have you ever:
* needed to send a fairly large file to a buddy, but need to clean up your Google drive before uploading?
* wanted to share... linux distros \***cough**\* without letting the world know you're sharing it?
* wanted to copy files to/from your mobile device but your cable was [buggy / missing / in another room and is this file _that_ important anyway for me to get up and fetch the damn cable]?

Well, look no more, [Airdropper](https://slampunk.github.io/airdropper/) has your back! Seemlessly share files between devices on your local network or across the internet, with the assurance that no snooping eyes can intercept your traffic.
